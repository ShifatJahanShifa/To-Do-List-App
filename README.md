# ToDoList App üìù

The **ToDoList App** is a web application built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have developed this ToDoList app after my javascript training at Cefalo. I have tried to apply my javascript knowledge as much as I can to this project.   


## Features 
- Creation of todo tasks based on some categories
- Viewing the created todo tasks based on the categories
- Updatation of the created todo tasks
- Marking the todo tasks as completed 
- Deletion of the todo tasks
- Viewing the progress based on categories

### Core Concepts 
The core concepts used in my project are:     

1. **DOM Manipulation** : 
   DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation refers to the process of dynamically interacting with and modifying the structure, content, and style of a web page using JavaScript. 

      The usecase in my project:  
      The **To-Do List App** heavily relies on DOM Manipulation to perform some tasks such as:  
      - Dynamically adding new tasks to the task list by creating `<li>` element.
      - Update the progress bar based on the number of completed and total tasks.
      - Update the edited task text.
      - Remove tasks from the DOM when the **Delete** button is clicked.

    Example: (taskHandler.js)
    ```
    const listItem=document.createElement('li')
    listItem.className='task-lists'
    ...
    list.appendChild(listItem); // Adds the task to the DOM(tasklist)
    ```
2. **Event Handling**: 
  Event Handling refers to the process of capturing and responding to user interactions with HTML elements(e.g., clicks, keypresses) on the web page.

      The usecase in my project:  
      The app uses event handling to make it interactive and responsive to user actions. Such as-
      - Click Events: For adding tasks, deleting tasks, and selecting categories.
      - Change Events: For updating the state of tasks (e.g., marking them as completed).
      
      Example: (listener.js)
      ```
       submitButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => 
          {
              event.preventDefault()
              addTask(category)
          })
      ```
3. **Module**:
  Modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code into separate files, making it reusable and maintainable. In JavaScript, modules support both **commonJS** and **ESM** approach.


      The usecase in my project:    
      The app is modularized to achieve separation of concerns and improve maintainability. In my project, I have used **ESM** approach for modularization which uses `export` and `import` statements. The modules in my project are -
      - domElements.js: Handles DOM element references.
      - listener.js: Manages event listeners.
      - taskHandler.js: Handles task-related logic (e.g., adding, editing, deleting tasks).
      - storage.js: Manages saving and loading tasks from local storage.
      - ui.js: Updates the UI (progress number).
    
      Example: 
      ```
      import { initializeDomElements } from "./JavaScripts/domElements.js";
      import { addListener } from "./JavaScripts/listener.js";
      ```
       
4. **Local Storage**:
  Local Storage is a web storage API that allows us to store key-value pairs in the browser. The data persists even after the browser is closed. We can store up to 5MB data per origin using localStorage. 
  
      The usecase in my project:     
      I have used Local Storage to save tasks so that they can persist across browser sessions. The data associated with my application can easily fit into 5MB as it is small scale application till now. If the data size increases in future, I may switch to `indexedDB` storage which can store more than 5MB data and up to some GB. Tasks are saved based on their category and their state (e.g., completed or not).  
      Example: (storage.js)
      ```
      localStorage.setItem(categoryName, JSON.stringify(tasks));
      const savedTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(categoryName)) || [];
      ```


### ES6 Features

The ES6 features used in my project are: 

1. **Arrow Function**: 
   Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They use the `=>` syntax and do not bind their own `this` context.

      The usecase in my project:     
      Arrow functions simplify the code and make it more readable. I have used arrow functions syntax in every places where I have functions such as-
      - Event handler function. 
      - Functions to store and retrieve data to local storage. 
      - Task adding function.
      - Progress updating function.
   
      Example: (script.js)
      ```
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{
          initializeDomElements()
          addListener()
          loadTasksFromLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
          updateProgress()
      })
      ```
2. **let, const**:  
   I have tried to implement proper scope for variables. For that reason, I have used let and const keyword for variable declaration. The variables which may change its value are declared using **let**. The variables which may not change its value are declared using **const**.

  - **let** (storage.js)
    ```js
    let tasks=[]
    ```
  - **const** (storage.js)
    ```js
    const savedTasks=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(selectedCategory)) || []
    ```
    
3. **Template Literal String**: 
   Template Literal String provides an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. Using it, we can use variables inside string where the variable will eventually be evaluated to its value. This     is called `string interpolation`.

   Example: (ui.js)
   ```
   progressNumber.textContent=`Completed Task: ${completedTask}/${totalTask}`
   ```


### Details of each Module
   
`script.js`  

This is the main js file of my project. In this file, I have 
- imported necessary functions from other files. 
- initialized dom elements by invoking `initializeDomElements` function.
- invoked `addListener` function for adding event listener to elements.
- loaded tasks from localStorage by invoking `loadtasksFromLocalStorage` function with passing the default selected category.
- updated the progress number by invoking `updateProgress` function.

``` js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{
    initializeDomElements()
    addListener()
    loadTasksFromLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
    updateProgress()
})
``` 

`domElements.js`  

In this file, I have - 
- declared necessary variables for storing dom elements.
- initialized the variables for elements such as - select (holds category options), paragraph (holds progress number), input (takes user input), button (acts as form submit button), ul (holds tasks as list items).
- exported the variables. 

```js
    categoryNames=document.getElementById('category')  // select 
    progressNumber=document.getElementById('progress-number')  // paragraph
    inputBox=document.getElementById('input-box')    // input
    submitButton=document.getElementById('submit-button')    // button
    list=document.getElementById('list')   // ul
``` 


`listener.js` 

In this file, I have added event listener to the `select` and `submit button` element. After importing all necessary functions, variables, I have added a function named `addListener` which is responsible for adding event listener to the elements. 


The `select` element which holds the category names is stored in a variable named `categoryNames`. I have added an event to this element named `change`. When the event fires, the handler will perform some tasks. The tasks -
- fetches the current value of the select element. 
- removes the list items from `ul` element.
- loads the stored tasks for the selected category from the local Storage.
- invokes the `updateProgress` function to update the progress number based on the loaded tasks.

```js
   categoryNames.addEventListener('change',()=>{
        category=categoryNames.value;
        list.innerHTML=''
        loadTasksFromLocalStorage(category)
        updateProgress()
    })
``` 

I have added `click` event with form submit button. When the event fires, the handler will perform some tasks. Such as 
- At first, the event is prevented using `event.preventDefault()`. This is necessary because, by default, clicking a submit button inside a form triggers a full page reload. In my project, I don't want this behavior. I want to handle the form submission using JavaScript without refreshing the page.
- then I have invoked `addTask` function passing with the current selected category to add the new task to the category. 


`taskhandler.js` 

This file is responsible for handling task addition to the task list, adding update and delete event with the task. 

The `addTask` function is invoked whenever a task is added. At first, it retrieves the task text from the input box. Task can be added in two scenarios. One is when a new task is added. The other one is when we add the updated task text. 

To achieve this scenario, I have used the `editing` variable. If `editing` is set to true, then it will update the task text and save to the local storage. After executing this, the `editing` is set to **false** indicating the editing is done.

```js
    if(editing) 
    {
        const listItem=list.children[idx]
        const span=listItem.querySelector('span');
        span.innerText=taskText;
        editing = false;
        inputBox.value=""
        saveTasksToLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
    }
``` 

If the `editing` is false, it will execute the `else` block. It will invoke `additems` function. After adding the items, it will save the task to local storage and update the progress. 

```js
    else 
    {
        addItems(selectedCategory,taskText,completed)
        inputBox.value=""
        saveTasksToLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
        updateProgress()
    }
``` 

In the `addItems` function, it creates a list element, an input element with type `checkbox`, a span element for containing the task text,a button for update and delete operation. 

The input element has a `change` event associated with it. When the event fires, the updated task state is stored in localStorage and the progress is updated. 

```js
input.addEventListener('change',()=>{
        completed=input.checked
        saveTasksToLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
        updateProgress()
    })
```

It adds `click` event with `update` button. When the update button is clicked, if the task is not marked as completed, it will set the input element's value with the task's text which we want to update. It will also set the editing value to true and retrieve the index of the `li` element which text content we want to update from the `ul` element's children list. 

```js
 updateBtn.addEventListener('click',()=>{
        if(!input.checked) 
        {
            inputBox.value=text.innerText
            editing=true
            idx=Array.from(list.children).indexOf(listItem)
        }
        
    })
``` 

It also adds `click` event with `delete` button. When this event fires, it will delete the selected element. Also it detects whether we are deleting the element which we wanted to update. If it is so, then it sets the editing to `false` ( meaning we no longer want to update element as it is deleted ). After deleting the element, it updates the local storage and progress.

```js
deleteBtn.addEventListener('click',()=>{
        let idx2=Array.from(list.children).indexOf(listItem)
        if(editing && (idx==idx2)) editing=false
        listItem.remove()
        saveTasksToLocalStorage(selectedCategory)
        updateProgress()
    })
``` 

Then it will append the input, span, update and delete button to the `li` element. Finally it will append the created `li` element to the `ul` element. 

```js
    listItem.appendChild(input)
    listItem.appendChild(text)
    listItem.appendChild(updateBtn)
    listItem.appendChild(deleteBtn)

    list.append(listItem)
``` 

`ui.js` 

This file contains one function called `updateProgress`. When this function is invoked, it will update the progress number based on the current selected category. 

```js
export const updateProgress=()=>{
    const totalTask=list.children.length
    const completedTask=list.querySelectorAll('.list-item:checked').length
   
    progressNumber.textContent=`Completed Task: ${completedTask}/${totalTask}`
}
``` 

`storage.js` 

This file is responsible for saving the tasks to local storage and retrieving the tasks from local storage. 

In the `saveTasksToLocalStorage` function, it is saving the tasks (list items) of the current `ul` elements to the local storage where the key is the current selected category. It is saving the task as an array of objects with property name **text** and **completion**.

```js
export const saveTasksToLocalStorage=(selectedCategory)=>{
  const lists=list.querySelectorAll('li')
  let tasks=[]
  for (let i=0;i< lists.length; i++) 
  {
      let temp={
          text: lists[i].querySelector('span').textContent,
          completed: lists[i].querySelector('.list-item').checked
      }
      tasks.push(temp)
  }

  localStorage.setItem(selectedCategory,JSON.stringify(tasks))
}
``` 

In the `loadTasksFromLocalStorage` function, it is loading the tasks from the local storage and adding each of them to the `ul` list by invoking `addItems` function.
```js
export const loadTasksFromLocalStorage=(selectedCategory)=>{
    const savedTasks=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(selectedCategory)) || []

    for(let i=0;i<savedTasks.length;i++) 
    {
        addItems(selectedCategory,savedTasks[i].text,savedTasks[i].completed)
    }
}
```
