# ToDoList App üìù

I have developed this ToDoList app after my javascript training at Cefalo. I have tried to apply the knowledge as much as I can to this project.   

The **ToDoList App** is a web application built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We can perform **CRUD** operation here. We can create todo lists based on some category, read the created todos category wise, update the added todos, mark the todo task as done and delete the todo task.
